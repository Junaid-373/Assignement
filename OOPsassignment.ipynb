        "The Diamond Problem (also known as the \"Deadly Diamond of Death\") is an issue that arises in programming languages that support multiple inheritance. It occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class. This results in a \"diamond\" shape in the class hierarchy, and the problem comes from ambiguity when methods or attributes are inherited from the common ancestor class.\n",
